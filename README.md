	Introduction
Last-mile delivery is defined as the delivery task between the final fulfillment center and the front door. The focus of that is to deliver items to the customer as fast as possible. It can be achieved by replacing human labor with robots to complete the delivery task. This project aims to develop a prototype of such an autonomous delivery robot that can complete short-distance delivery tasks.
The robot operates in a specific enclosed environment with several different rooms. Users send messages to the robot, and it is able to travel between any location inside the environment according to the command. It can organize paths automatically and perform localization and navigation with high accuracy. 
Theoretically, the robot is suitable for any short-distance delivery scenario, such as drug delivery in hospitals, Dishes serving in restaurants, and goods transportation in factories. It has excellent potential in terms of liberating the human workforce and promoting the automation industry.
